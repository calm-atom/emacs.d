;;; PERFORMANCE HACKS
;;; ========================================================
;; Emacs is an Elisp interpreter, and when running programs or packages,
;; it can occasionally experience pauses due to garbage collection.
;; By increasing the garbage collection threshold, we reduce these pauses
;; during heavy operations, leading to smoother performance.
(setq gc-cons-threshold #x40000000)

;; Set the maximum output size for reading process output, allowing for larger data transfers.

;;; PACKAGE MANAGER SETUP
;;; ========================================================
;; Emacs comes with a built-in package manager (`package.el'), and we'll use it
;; when it makes sense. However, `straight.el' is a bit more user-friendly and
;; reproducible, especially for newcomers and shareable configs like emacs-kick.
;; So we bootstrap it here.
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil) ;; Disables the default package manager.

;; Bootstraps `straight.el'
(setq straight-check-for-modifications nil)
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name
        "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el"
        (or (bound-and-true-p straight-base-dir)
            user-emacs-directory)))
      (bootstrap-version 7))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radian-software/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)

(straight-use-package '(project :type built-in))
(straight-use-package 'use-package)

;; In Emacs, a package is a collection of Elisp code that extends the editor's functionality,
;; much like plugins do in Neovim. We need to import this package to add package archives.
(require 'package)

;; Add MELPA (Milkypostman's Emacs Lisp Package Archive) to the list of package archives.
;; This allows you to install packages from this widely-used repository, similar to how
;; pip works for Python or npm for Node.js. While Emacs comes with ELPA (Emacs Lisp
;; Package Archive) configured by default, which contains packages that meet specific
;; licensing criteria, MELPA offers a broader range of packages and is considered the
;; standard for Emacs users. You can also add more package archives later as needed.
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

;; Define a global customizable variable `ek-use-nerd-fonts' to control the use of
;; Nerd Fonts symbols throughout the configuration. This boolean variable allows
;; users to easily enable or disable the use of symbols from Nerd Fonts, providing
;; flexibility in appearance settings. By setting it to `t', we enable Nerd Fonts
;; symbols; setting it to `nil' would disable them.

;;; ========================================================
;;; BUILT-IN PACKAGE SETUP
;;; ========================================================
;; From now on, you'll see configurations using the `use-package` macro, which
;; allows us to organize our Emacs setup in a modular way. These configurations
;; look like this:
;;
;; (use-package some-package
;;   :ensure t     ;; Ensure the package is installed (used with package.el).
;;   :straight t   ;; Use straight.el to install and manage this package.
;;   :config       ;; Configuration settings for the package.
;;   ;; Additional settings can go here.
;; )
;;
;; This approach simplifies package management, enabling us to easily control
;; both built-in (first-party) and external (third-party) packages. While Emacs
;; is a vast and powerful editor, using `use-package`—especially in combination
;; with `straight.el`—helps streamline our configuration for better organization,
;; reproducibility, and customization. As we proceed, you'll see smaller
;; `use-package` declarations for specific packages, which will help us enable
;; the desired features and improve our workflow.

;;; DIRED

;; and associations for opening various file types with their respective applications.
